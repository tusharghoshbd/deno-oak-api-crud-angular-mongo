## Restful API: 
Open a terminal in root folder and run the following command

`deno run  --allow-net  --allow-write --allow-read --allow-plugin --
unstable server.ts`

Now the server will run in port 8000 and go to http://localhost:8000/  to access the api.

## Frontend (Angular):
Frontend part is maintained in the client folder where we have implemented the Angular 9. So go the client folder and open a Terminal and run the following command.

    * npm install
    * ng serve

After application will run in 4200 port. So go to http://localhost:4200/ to access the application.
